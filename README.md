Today I Learned - a journal of things added to my bag of tricks.

Inspired by @thoughtbot's project of the same name at
https://github.com/thoughtbot/til

..this will be short articles on techniques I've either newly learned,
or used in production for the first time.

Longer, more polished entries will be published on my blog,
Barbarian Developer, at http://barbarian.me
